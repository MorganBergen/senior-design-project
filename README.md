####  to do

-  propose a project or choose a project
-  form a group of 2 - 3 members
-  write out a proposal
-  learn related technologies
-  implement the project, note that we will have three prototype checkpoints

**example of a started project**

```cpp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build()

// add middleware, such as authentication, routing, etc.
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World!");
app.mapPost("/hello", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
```

####  what you should know

-  should be able to recognize and identify patterns of the certain technologies
-  you should be able to learn new technologies quickly
-  react js, docker containers, vue, angular, python, ruby on rails, and other technologies

####  grading items

-  proposal: 10%
-  prototype 1: 15%
-  prototype 2: 15%
-  prototype 3: 15%
-  engineering open house 10%
-  team work documents (meeting minutes, team member tasks, etc): 15%, 5% each
-  miscellaneous: 20%

####  schedule

week 1 - 2 - choose the project
week 3 - first submission of proposal

####  ideas of proposals

##  Synopsis

####  Summary

Clarity is a web and mobile application that leverages image recognition and machine learning to analyze the nutritional content of food and comprehensive health management tool.  Designed to empower users with real time dietary insights and transform the way individuals manage their chronic conditions, nutrition, and overall health.

####  How it works

Users captures or uploads images or scan barcodes of their food using Clarity.  The app then provides comprehensive nutritional analysis, dietary trends, and provide personalized recommendations based on the user's health goals or chronic conditions.  Clarity can also predicts or mitigates disease risk factors, and allocates data for health care providers.  

####  Who benefits

1.  **Patients with Chronic Conditions** -  Clarity assist those needing dietary monitoring, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and obesity.  Clarity can help patients manage their conditions and provide their healthcare providers with data to make informed decisions.

2.  **Insured Individuals** -  Users seeking to reduce healthcare costs will find Clarity invaluable for incentive programs that help reduce insurance premiums based on health data.

3.  **Athletes** -  Optimize performance and recovery with nutritional insights and recommendations.

4.  **Personal Trainers** -  To track their clients' progress and provide personalized recommendations to achieve their health and fitness goals.

5.  **Health-conscious Individuals** -  Anyone looking to enhance their well-being to make more informed dietary choices, track trends, prevent disease, and improve overall health.

##  Introduction

####  Background Information

[Most chronic disease are caused by risk factors such as poor nutrition and excessive alcohol use.](https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Most%20chronic%20diseases%20are%20caused,feeling%20good%2C%20and%20living%20longer.)  By avoiding these risks and receiving good preventative care Clarity can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

####  Problem Statement

The current healthcare system is intervention based and reactive.  Clarity aims to be proactive and preventative by providing users and healthcare providers with real-time data to make informed decisions about their health.

####  Objectives

1.  Nutritional Analysis and Insights
2.  Personalized Dietary Recommendations
3.  Health Monitoring and Trend Analysis
4.  Disease Risk Management
5.  Data Sharing with Healthcare Providers
6.  Reduce Healthcare Costs
7.  Support Athletic Performance and Personal Training
8.  Enhance Overall Health and Well-being

Nutritional Analysis and Insights -  Insights into macronutrient and micronutrient in take.  Inform users about carcinogens, pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, artificial additives, trans fats, acrylamide, and other harmful substances in their food.

Personalized Dietary Recommendations -  Help users meet specific nutritional needs, such as managing cholesterol, blood sugar, blood pressure, or weight through personalized recommendations.  Provide users with meal plans, recipes, and grocery lists.

Health Monitoring and Trend Analysis -  Track dietary trends, allow users to log biometric data (integrated with wearables or medical devices such as glucose monitors, blood pressure monitors)

Disease Risk Management -  Use dietary data to predict potential health risks and offer preventive guidance to mitigate these risks.

Data Sharing with Healthcare Providers -  Allow users to share their nutritional data with healthcare providers by exporting reports into formats such as PDF, CSV, through API integrations, or HL7 (Health Level Seven International), CDA (Clinical Document Architecture), or FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards.

Reduce Healthcare Costs -  Incentivize users to reduce healthcare costs by providing data to insurance companies for premium reductions.

Support Athletic Performance and Personal Training -  Provide athletes and personal trainers with nutritional insights to optimize performance and recovery.

Enhance Overall Health and Well-being -  Empower users to make informed dietary choices, track trends, prevent disease, and improve overall health.

##  Project Description

Clarity will be using the following features to achieve the objectives of the project:

1.  User profile and data input

users provide their specific information, including age, gender, weight, medical history, medications, and other relevant health data.  the user can set specific health goals related to their dietary needs, such as managing diabetes, losing weight, or improving overall wellness.

2.  Mobile device image capture

users capture images of their meals using a mobile device.  the software should be user friendly and guide users on how to take clear and useful photos for analysis.

3.  Image analysis and nutritional data extraction

[ai powered analysis](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/) will consist of uploaded images to a desktop software where machine learning algorithms analyze the food items for nutritional content, portion sizes, and dietary composition.

The app allows users to scan the barcode of products, to view the product information, and to take and submit pictures and data for missing products. [ios app](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios)

####  Methodology

####  Tools and Technologies

**Backend**
-  Node.js - for server-side development
-  Express.js - framework for node.js for handling server requests, routing, and api endpoints
-  [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) - for cloud storage, user authentication, hosting, and database

**Frontend**
-  React - for building the user interface
-  [Material UI](https://mui.com) - for design components
-  Redux - for state management
-  Axios - for making https requests
-  React Native Health - for integrating with HealthKit

**Machine Learning**
-  [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com)
-  Roboflow Universe
-  Google Cloud Vision API
-  IMB Watson Visual Recognition

**Barcode Scanning**
-  Open Food Facts API - for food identification and nutritional information via barcode scanning

Option to Train Custom Models
-  TensorFlow and Keras 
-  Pytorch

Dataset for Custom Model
-  Food 101
-  UPMC Food 101

1.  Select a framework - use tensorflow, keras, or pytorch
2.  Obtain a dataset -  download a food image dataset such as foo101
3.  Train the model -  use the dataset to train a model to recognize different food items
4.  Deploy the model -  use a free cloud service provider that offers a free tier like keroku and create an api around the model using a framework like flask or python
5.  Use the api -  connect the api to perform food recognition tasks

##  Design

The design of the application will consists of a user journey that includes the following screens:

1.  **Login Screen** -  Users can login or create an account to access the app.
2.  **Dashboard** -  Users can view their daily nutritional intake, health data, and personalized recommendations.
3.  **Analysis** -  Users can view detailed analysis of their meals, dietary trends, and health insights.
4.  **Settings** -  Users can update their profile, health goals, and preferences.
5.  **Reports** -  Users can export their data for healthcare providers or insurance companies.
6.  etc.
