#  senior design project I

this class is for computer science senior students to take to complete a project that is highly related to the cs field.

##  to do

-  propose a project or choose a project
-  form a group of 2 - 3 members
-  write out a proposal
-  learn related technologies
-  implement the project, note that we will have three prototype checkpoints

**example of a started project**

```cpp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build()

// add middleware, such as authentication, routing, etc.
app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");
app.MapGet("/hello", () => "Hello World!");
app.mapPost("/hello", () => "Hello World!");
app.Run();
```

##  what you should know

-  should be able to recognize and identify patterns of the certain technologies
-  you should be able to learn new technologies quickly
-  react js, docker containers, vue, angular, python, ruby on rails, and other technologies

##  grading items

-  proposal: 10%
-  prototype 1: 15%
-  prototype 2: 15%
-  prototype 3: 15%
-  engineering open house 10%
-  team work documents (meeting minutes, team member tasks, etc): 15%, 5% each
-  miscellaneous: 20%

##  schedule

week 1 - 2 - choose the project
week 3 - first submission of proposal

##  ideas of proposals
